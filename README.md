**:warning: This is a work in progress. It's incomplete and hacky.**



This is a little tool I'm developing to help me practice guitar playing (and to play with new technologies). 
The idea is to combine a metronome, looper and tuner toghether with some simple statistics to track
progress. The metronome and tuner are working, I haven't started on the looper yet.
